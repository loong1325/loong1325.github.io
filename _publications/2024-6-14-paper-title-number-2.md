When magma erupts from the mantle, it undergoes a cooling process and eventually solidifies into rock. This cooling process is accompanied by contraction, leading to the development of stress within the magma. The most evident result of this is the formation of columnar joints, a hexagonal column structure commonly observed in volcanic rocks. Studying the columnar joints in volcanic rocks can provide insights into the properties of the magma and the conditions of its cooling environment.

Through this research, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind the formation of various igneous rock structures, which is significant for comprehending geological processes on other planetary bodies where volcanic activity plays a crucial role in shaping their surfaces. Additionally, this study demonstrates the application of material mechanics and fluid dynamics to real geological phenomena, contributing to the quantitative and scientific development of geology.
